FarmChainX

Status: Work in Progress (WIP)

🚀 Overview

FarmChainX is an AI and blockchain-powered supply chain platform built for the agriculture industry.
It ensures transparency, traceability, and authenticity for farm products — from the farmer’s field to the consumer’s hands.
The project combines Spring Boot for backend APIs, blockchain for tamper-proof records, and AI for quality checks and demand forecasting.
